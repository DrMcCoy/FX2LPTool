CyUSB Suite
***********
   FX2LPTool is partially based on the CyUSB Suite for Linux by Cypress
   Semiconductor Corporation. The CyUSB Suite for Linux is licensed under
   version 2 of the GNU General Public License.

   More specifically, the information on which USB requests to send has
   been taken out of the CyUSB Suite sources. FX2LPTool also uses the
   original Cypress FX2 vend_ax firmware to aid in interfacing with the
   Cypress FX2 chip.
